Jquery Plugin for pkautocomplete.

1. How to use pkautocomplete in your jquery page?
	You can use pkautocomplete like any jquery widget.
	Create two empty divs on for every autocomplete field you would like to see.

<div id = "autocomplete"></div>
<div id="dataDiv"></div>

	You can use “autocomplete” to fill in the actual component.
	“dataDiv” is used to publicly store a comma separated value list of the autocomplete.

Instantiate pkautocomplete as follows.

$('#autocomplete').pkautocomplete(
	{	
		criteriaName: "pavi",
		url:"http://herokory.herokuapp.com/autocomplete/jsonpCallback/",
		dataDiv:"dataDiv"
	});			
});

The ui widget takes three options.
criteriaName – uniquename for the autocomplete instance.
url – The ajax url to which one can append the autocomplete candidate.
dataDiv – Here you can find 'value' attribute which contains a comma separated list of the selected chiclet values.


2. Usability factors of pkautocomplete

Type in your candidate data in the input box.
If the ajax call completes, you will find a list of data under the input box.
You can use arrow keys or mouse point to select your value.
You can click/press enter/press tab to finalise your previous selection.
A small chiclet appears under the input box with the value selected.
Each chiclet will have a close button , on clicking which the chiclet value is removed from the ui and list.
The dataDiv will have the comma separated list of values selected and showing as chiclets. $(dataDiv).attr('value') will give the value.
